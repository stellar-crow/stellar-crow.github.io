*Ever Research Base [Abandoned] 11:39 A.M.*

Jenna: Rookies, this is Jenna speaking. I'm your UNICORNS Caption today. Ten minutes ago, there was an abnormal Metalfux explosion at this abandoned base for Protocore research.

MC: (The flutuations are stronger. I'm closer to the source.)

MC: (Ah!)

??: Oh! Your Evol's even better than the detector.

Tara: Hi, I'm Tara. Remember me? I was standing next to you during the badge ceremony.

MC: Of course. I'm _**MC**_. We're lucky to be on the same squad. Do you want to work together?

Tara: Sure! The tarot reading I did yesterday told me that I would be super lucky today.

MC: Look!

[IM-D-21 2193-0081 Wanderer detected. Accept the mission?]

Tara: Wanderers! They're here.

Tara: ...The highest threat level here is only B, which matches the fluctuation we just left.

MC: A fluctuation doesn't have a set value... Something's off.

Tara: Why don't we split up and look around first? Just to be safe.

MC: Sure, I'll go inside then.

Tara: I'll scout the perimeter to see how far these fluctuations go. We'll regroup here once we're done.

Tara: Be careful!

MC: You too!

MC: (There's clearly been a Metaflux explosion, but it doesn't match the Wanderers' threat level... Something's not right.)
MC: (What?!)

*Abandoned Research Base: Deep*

MC: (...A hunter? Are they also here for the mission?)

MC: (There are traces of Metaflux on him. As if he was attacked...)

MC: (At first glance... He doesn't seem to be injured.)

MC: (I should all for backup.)

|Call for emergency backup?
Yes|
[HM-D-2193-0081: Call for emergency backup - calling]
Calling for backups...
Calling...
???: Quiet...
MC: Are you all right?
??: I'm fine. But you...
MC: Fluctuations!
??: Watch out.
??: It activated its Protofield. You're a hunter, right? Let's defeat it together.
——————————

UNICORNS: One of the teams under the Hunters Association. First established during the disaster 14 years old, it is responsible for dealing with Wanderer-related incidents, especially those involving dangerous Wanderers. Its logo is that of a unicorn.

Tara: The first colleague I befriended after becoming a hunter. Young with a cute personality that suits her name. aside from being in the know on interesting gossip and info, she really likes divination and the occult. Not only is she a true friend, but also a trustworthy teammate.

Protofield: Wanderers create ab alternate dimension using an anergy field. Currently, all relevant information is from hunters who have fought them.

Because of the threats lurking in these mysterious Protofield, the Hunters Association requires two Evolvers to present in them so they can support each other. They must also be ready to retreat should one of them encounter any danger.
