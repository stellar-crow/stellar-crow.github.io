...Fourteen years ago, the Deepspace Tunnel appeared above Linkon. It led to anomalous geomagnetic storms, and the creatures known as Wanderers emerged.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
From such an event, the Deepspace Hunter was born.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
Now society has returned to a sense of normalcy, but there are still Wanderers lurking in the shadows...

<span class="dialog-block">??</span><br/>
After they hand out our badges, we'll be assigned to a squad, which will determine our future. Aren't you nervous?

<span class="dialog-block-right">Me</span><br/>
<span class="dialog-block-right-text">That won't change the outcome. It's better to stay calm.</span>

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
Our goal as hunters is to extract the Protocores from Wanderers â€” in hopes of destroying them once and for all!

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
That being said, congratulations on passing the selection process. We are grateful for your hard work.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
We will now begin the ceremony and hand out badges to the new Deepspace Hunters.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
First candidate, XXXXXX.

<span class="dialog-block">??</span><br/>
That's you, isn't it? Hurry, get on stage!

<span class="dialog-block-right">Me</span><br/>
<span class="dialog-block-right-text">Hello, sir.</span>

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
Place your hand here to confirm your personal info.

Ah, Anhaunsen Class... It's been a while since I've seen this Evol.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
You have a lot of potential for growth and might even acquire new abilities. I can see why Jenna picked you as soon as the rookie list was released to the public.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
It can't be detected?

<span class="dialog-block-right">Me</span><br/>
<span class="dialog-block-right-text">(Sigh, as usual.)</span>

<span class="dialog-block-right">Me</span><br/>
<span class="dialog-block-right-text">Sir, that's likely because a Wanderer attacked me fourteen years ago. And ever since then, my Evol level hasn't been stable.</span>

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
...Understood. That event did change many lives forever.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
You're not the first Evolver whose level couldn't be detected. 

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
This isn't the only criterion we use when evaluating a Deepspace Hunter.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
As long as you have the skills, this industry welcomes you with open arms.

<span class="dialog-block">President</span><br/>
Congratulations, you are now a Deepspace Hunter.

<span class="dialog-block-right">Me</span><br/>
<span class="dialog-block-right-text">Thank you, sir!</span>
